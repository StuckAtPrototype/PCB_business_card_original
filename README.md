## Project Structure
The project consists of
1. Firmware
2. Hardware

## Firmware
You will need to set up the environment from scratch. You can use any method youd like, but the method mentioned below is probably the easiest.

### Compilation
You will need to obtain chip related code. The "API" from NXP. This comes with Keil uVision. I recommend using it for simplicity. 

The chip is MKE04Z4

# Hardware
I am including everything youd need to make one of these.
